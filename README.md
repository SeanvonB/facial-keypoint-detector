# Facial Keypoint Detector

[LIVE DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOK](https://seanvonb.github.io/facial-keypoint-detector/)

This is a project from my [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891), which I completed in 2020. It's an exploration of using [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs) to map key facial features on images of faces. This work provides the foundation for any number of other hypothetical projects, like facial filters, facial tracking, facial pose recognition, emotion recognition, occupancy summation, and so on.

The project was broken down into four steps:
1.	Load and visualize data to become familiar with the dataset
2.	Define network architecture and train model
3.	Deploy the model as a facial keypoint detector
4.	Do important data science, i.e. put sunglasses and moustaches on faces

Probably the most valuable outcome will be the [development notebook](https://seanvonb.github.io/facial-keypoint-detector/) itself, which I think could be a useful reference for future machine learning projects. I covered all of the topics listed above in detail, so please do take a look if that sounds interesting to you.

## Features

-   Train CNNs to map 68 facial keypoints on images of faces
-	Locate faces in images with OpenCV's [Haar Cascade](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html) classifier
-	Highlight differences between classification and regression tasks
-	Apply goofy filters to image data

## Credits

-   This project was part [Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).
-   Image data, provided by Udacity, is a modified sample of the [YouTube Faces Database](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/).
